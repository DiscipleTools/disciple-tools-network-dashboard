# Disciple.Tools - Network Dashboard

The Network Dashboard creates report data sharing between multiple Disciple.Tools systems. It seeks to
facilitate solidarity, saturation, data safety, and prayer guidance.

It offers an "out of the box" dashboard of activity and movement progress that can be shared safely between
Disciple.Tools partner sites.

__The Network Dashboard is a Disciple.Tools power tool!__

## Purpose

- __Solidarity:__ Multiple teams working in the same geographic area can combine their Disciple.Tools movement data
for solidarity in the kingdom advancement in that area (i.e. solidarity as in: "we're in this together"
or "our win is your win, your win is our win. Maranatha!" ).
- __Saturation:__ Multiple teams can see clearly the saturation of contacts, groups, and workers in their geographic area
for the purpose [seeing where the kingdom isn't](https://zume.training/eyes-to-see-where-the-kingdom-isnt/).
- __Data Safety:__ Great effort has been put into the removal of Personally Identifiable Data (understanding the rising
concern with privacy laws) and reducing precision of location data, but in a way that is still valuable to
saturation efforts and movement health understanding.
- __Prayer Guidance:__ Using the new shared activity logging, movement events (new baptisms, new contacts, new churches, etc),
will be immediately communicated across the network to feed prayer and praise coverage.

## Usage

#### Will Do

- Display combined maps and statistics from multiple Disciple.Tools sites.
- Automatically run daily collections from all connected Disciple.Tools sites.
- Supports linking and unlinking systems. When a link is removed, data in remote system is removed.
- Runs on basic Wordpress server without additional Geospacial systems or customer server configurations.

#### Will Not Do

- __Does not support daisy chaining site reports.__ I.e. Site-A sends Site-B data, but Site-B never sends Site-A's data to
Site-C. The Network Dashboard only passes data to explicit connections. This is to protect the data owners control of
how far the data can be transfered and displayed.

## Requirements

- Disciple.Tools Theme installed on a Wordpress Server.
- Site must have SSL enabled.


## Installing

- Install as a standard Disciple.Tools/Wordpress plugin in the system Admin/Plugins area.
- Requires the user role of Administrator.

## Documentation

View the [Documentation Wiki](https://github.com/DiscipleTools/disciple-tools-network-dashboard/wiki) for extensive explanation of the plugin.
